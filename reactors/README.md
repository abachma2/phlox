### List of Directories

- fuel-fidelity: contains models and analysis for an in-depth analysis on isotopic fuel compostions in a micro-HTGR using a multi-pass fuel cycle. (not yet implemented)
- full-core: contains the full-core models for both the 20 and 200 MWth models, and any analysis or post-processing
- single-pebble: contains the single-pebble depletion models used to generate the fuel isotopic compositions used in the full core models
