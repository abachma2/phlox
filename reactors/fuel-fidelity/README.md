# Fuel Fidelity (Not Yet Implemented)

This directory's contents are for a study of the effects of the degree of complexity with which fuel pebbles are modeled in a 20 MWth htgr.  This is to ultimately help inform decisions on modeling fidelity in other HTGRs.

### List of Directories

- ax-comp-study contains Serpent 2 simulations and any other supporting work for exploring the isotopic compositions of fuel pebbles, roughly as a function of height in the core.
- init-conds is contains the initial conditions, and any supporting work to establish them, for the ax-comp-study simulations
